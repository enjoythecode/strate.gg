## Amazons Bots
Collection of AI models that play the Game of the Amazons.

## Getting Started

`amazons_state.py` is the base class that holds a game state.  
`amazons_agent.py` defines the base methods that all classes should have.  
`game_manager.py` pits agents against each other and records the results.
