# Strate.gg

A website dedicated to the play and exploration of various abstract strategy board games. My ambition is to build a website for real-time and correspondence matches of games such as Amazons and Hex, as well as complimentary tools such as an analysis board, puzzles, and AI opponents.

I am also using this project as an opportunity to learn good software development practices such as containerization (Docker), testing, tooling (linting, auto-formatting, commit hooks).
